# Using Deep Learning to Classify Dog Breeds from Images

This project looks to implement a deep learning model in order to classify dog breeds from labeled images of dogs. Using deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in particular, we will build both a scratch-made CNN as well as using transfer learning to implement a CNN that uses the pre-created Inception architecture.

## Installations

The project makes use primarily of Python code within a Jupyter Notebook. For datasets, the project uses **Scikit-Learn** to import dog images as well as **glob** for the human face images. For the CNN architecture, this project uses **Keras** backed by TensorFlow.

PLEASE NOTE that this work was completed in a GPU-enabled workspace provided by Udacity. It is not recommended to run this project on a general CPU due to computational limitations.
